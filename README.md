## Heads up

This page is designed to help anyone interested in a career in software development learn some of the foundational elements that **_I think_** are key to getting started (or deciding if you'd even want to). I consider myself a pragmatist and do my best to follow the KISS principle, so my aim is for **NO FLUFF, ALL STUFF**.

Web development jobs seem to be in high demand and most pay well (start around 50k and work up to 100k+) with lots of flexibility. You may even be able to do development in your spare time for extra income or to decide if you like it. Work from home? Definitely an option. The web isn't going away any time soon either, and if you get great at web development you can always move into other specialties (AI, data science, mobile, games, cloud, etc.) down the line.

Since my career has been mostly business focused and **_I'm not a professional teacher_**, I'll be pointing you to links that **_I think_** are worthwhile. **All the content is free** on Khan Academy (KA). Please feel free to watch any extra videos that interest you and/or setup and account to help track your progress (I think they have multiple ways to do that but haven't tried myself). Different people learn different ways though, so if you don't like KA or prefer to just read and do examples, I'm including w3schools links too (it's a great reference regardless).

IMO, if you're willing to be a hard worker, are a decent communicator, care about other people, and are OK with (or excited about) constantly learning, you should be able to succeed in a development career! A college degree doesn't hurt but it's def not a requirement for success in web development.

**PRO TIP**: _look for the speed setting on all videos. I watch everything at 2x speed and slow it down or repeat a section if I need to._ ;-)

## Basics

Spend ~30min (or 15min at 2x speed) in [KA's "Computer Science" section](https://www.khanacademy.org/computing/computer-science)..

### Internet 101

* What is the internet (4min) and
* HTTP and HTML (7min)

### How computers work

* Intro (1min)
* How computers work (5min)
* Hardware and software (5min)

You can spend as much time as you like watching other videos as they're probably all worthwhile, but I'm trying to stay laser focused so let's jump right into..

## Building web sites

Now you'll learn about the 3 core pieces of a web app:

* HTML - structure
* CSS - styling
* Javascript (JS) - functionality (aka behavior)

FWIW, **_I_** define a web **site** as a mostly static (i.e. not changing much) page of information (think wikipedia or the page you're reading now) whereas a web **application** has dynamic data and functionality built into it (ala gmail or facebook).

**NOTE**: _Please keep track of how long these take you, then LMK so I can update this page with that info!_

### Intro to HTML & CSS

I'd run thru the entire [KA Intro to HTML & CSS](https://www.khanacademy.org/computing/computer-programming/html-css). Focus more on the HTML than the CSS for now. I'm totally guessing.. this may take 5hrs..?

Here's the [w3schools alternative/add-on](https://www.w3schools.com/html/default.asp).

### Adding functionality with JS

I recommend **spending the most time** on [KA's Intro to JS for web apps](https://www.khanacademy.org/computing/computer-programming/html-css-js).. aside from the section on animation (cool, but def optional). Again, totally guessing.. this may take 10hrs..?

And the [w3schools alternative/add-on](https://www.w3schools.com/js/default.asp).

### jQuery

jQuery is ancient (in web years) but still widely used and helpful for basic web apps. The videos and examples in [KA's jQuery section](https://www.khanacademy.org/computing/computer-programming/html-js-jquery) are probably worth going thru (at 2x speed anyway), but you might find it faster to scan thru the [w3schools alternative](https://www.w3schools.com/jquery/default.asp). jQuery is less important than the previous section because frameworks like Angular, React and Vue are way more powerful (and valuable career-wise) once you get the HTML, CSS and JS basics down. However, jQuery will probably be around (people's jobs will include maintaining sites/apps that use it) for a long time. Since it elegantly glues HTML, CSS and JS (aka web) development, it will probably also help you get your brain wrapped around the concepts quicker. Guessing again.. this should maybe take 3hrs..?

## What's next

Kudos to you if you made it this far! To succeed in a development career (or maybe just get hired), you **MUST** have some proficiency in the basics. Those who are personable, communicate well, and are willing to take on (and maybe master) all the ancillary technology and techniques will likely elevate themselves above 80% of their peers. 

When I have time, I'll add more links and info (or do a screenshare walk-thru) related to

* Source control - git
* Tools - VSCode, GitHub, BitBucket
* Apps - TodoApp
* Frameworks - Node, React, Angular, NextJS
* Code camps
* Blogs and resumes
* APIs and databases
* Agile processes
* Human factors and communication
* Testing
* DevOps and cloud
