This site is designed to help anyone interested in a career in software development learn some of the foundational elements that **I think** are important to getting started. I consider myself very pragmatic and do my best to follow the KISS principle, so I'll do my best to skip the fluff and get right down to the stuff. Web development jobs seem to be in high demand, and most pay well with lots of flexibility. Since I'm not a professional teacher, I'll be pointing you to links that I think are worthwhile.. though I admit I haven't gone through everything myself. Most of the links will be on Khan Academy (KA), feel free to watch more and setup and account to help track your progress.

**PRO TIP**: _look for the speed setting on all videos. I watch everything in at least 2x speed and slow it down or repeat a section if I need to. That can cram 2hrs of learning into 1hr_ ;-)

## Basics

Spend ~30min (or 15min at 2x speed) in [KA's "Computer Science" section](https://www.khanacademy.org/computing/computer-science)..

### Internet 101

* What is the internet (4min) and
* HTTP and HTML (7min)

### How computers work

* Intro (1min)
* How computers work (5min)
* Hardware and software (5min)

You can spend as much time as you like watching other videos as they're probably all worthwhile, but I'm trying to stay laser focused so let's jump right into..

## Building web sites

### Intro to HTML & CSS

**NOTE**: _Please keep track of how long these take you, then LMK so I can update this page with that info!_

Now you'll learn about the 3 core pieces of a web app:

* HTML - structure
* CSS - styling
* Javascript (JS) - functionality (aka behavior)

FWIW, I define a web **site** as a static page of information (e.g. wikipedia or the page you're reading now) whereas a web **application** has some functionality built into it (e.g. gmail or facebook).

### Intro to HTML & CSS

I'd run thru the entire [KA Intro to HTML & CSS](https://www.khanacademy.org/computing/computer-programming/html-css). Focus more on the HTML than the CSS for now. 

### Adding functionality with JS

I'd take your time on [all of this](https://www.khanacademy.org/computing/computer-programming/html-css-js), aside from the animation (which is cool, but def optional).

### jQuery

jQuery is still widely used and pretty helpful for basic web apps. [KA's jQuery section](https://www.khanacademy.org/computing/computer-programming/html-js-jquery) is worth going thru (at 2x speed), though it's less important than the previous section because frameworks like Angular, React and Vue are probably better to learn once you get the HTML, CSS and JS basics down.
