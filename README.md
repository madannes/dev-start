This site is designed to help anyone interested in a career in software development learn some of the foundational elements that **I think** are important to getting started. I consider myself very pragmatic and do my best to follow the KISS principle, so I'll do my best to skip the fluff and get right down to the stuff. Web development jobs seem to be in high demand, and most pay well with lots of flexibility. Since I'm not a professional teacher, I'll be pointing you to links that I think are worthwhile.. though I admit I haven't gone through everything myself.

**PRO TIP**: *look for the speed setting on all videos. I watch everything in at least 2x speed and slow it down or repeat a section if I need to. That cuts 2hr tutorials in half* ;-)

## Internet basics

Khan Academy has lots of good info, I recommend watching *What is the internet* and *HTTP and HTML* at a minimum: https://www.khanacademy.org/computing/computer-science/internet-intro
