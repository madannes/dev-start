## Heads up

This site is designed to help anyone interested in a career in software development learn some of the foundational elements that **_I think_** are key to getting started (or deciding if you'd even want to). I consider myself a pragmatist and do my best to follow the KISS principle, so I'll try to skip the fluff and get right down to the stuff that **_I think_** matters. Web development jobs seem to be in high demand, and most pay well with lots of flexibility. Since **_I'm not a professional teacher_**, I'll be pointing you to links that **_I think_** are worthwhile. Most of the links will be on Khan Academy (KA), feel free to watch more and setup and account to help track your progress (I think they have multiple ways to do that but haven't tried myself). Different people learn different ways though, so if you don't like KA or prefer to read and do examples, I'm including w3schools links too (it's a great reference regardless).

**PRO TIP**: _look for the speed setting on all videos. I watch everything in at least 2x speed and slow it down or repeat a section if I need to. That can cram 2hrs of learning into 1hr_ ;-)

## Basics

Spend ~30min (or 15min at 2x speed) in [KA's "Computer Science" section](https://www.khanacademy.org/computing/computer-science)..

### Internet 101

* What is the internet (4min) and
* HTTP and HTML (7min)

### How computers work

* Intro (1min)
* How computers work (5min)
* Hardware and software (5min)

You can spend as much time as you like watching other videos as they're probably all worthwhile, but I'm trying to stay laser focused so let's jump right into..

## Building web sites

### Intro to HTML & CSS

**NOTE**: _Please keep track of how long these take you, then LMK so I can update this page with that info!_

Now you'll learn about the 3 core pieces of a web app:

* HTML - structure
* CSS - styling
* Javascript (JS) - functionality (aka behavior)

FWIW, I define a web **site** as a static page of information (e.g. wikipedia or the page you're reading now) whereas a web **application** has some functionality built into it (e.g. gmail or facebook).

### Intro to HTML & CSS

I'd run thru the entire [KA Intro to HTML & CSS](https://www.khanacademy.org/computing/computer-programming/html-css). Focus more on the HTML than the CSS for now. I'm totally guessing.. this may take 5hrs..?

Here's the [w3schools alternative/add-on](https://www.w3schools.com/html/default.asp).

### Adding functionality with JS

I recommend **spending the most time** on [KA's Intro to JS for web apps](https://www.khanacademy.org/computing/computer-programming/html-css-js).. aside from the section on animation (cool, but def optional). Again, totally guessing.. this may take 10hrs..?

And the [w3schools alternative/add-on](https://www.w3schools.com/js/default.asp).

### jQuery

jQuery is ancient (in web years) but still widely used and helpful for basic web apps. The videos and examples in [KA's jQuery section](https://www.khanacademy.org/computing/computer-programming/html-js-jquery) are probably worth going thru (at 2x speed anyway), but you might find it faster to scan thru the [w3schools alternative](https://www.w3schools.com/jquery/default.asp). jQuery is less important than the previous section because frameworks like Angular, React and Vue are way more powerful (and valuable career-wise) once you get the HTML, CSS and JS basics down. However, jQuery will probably be around (people's jobs will include maintaining sites/apps that use it) for a long time. Since it elegantly glues HTML, CSS and JS (aka web) development, it will probably also help you get your brain wrapped around the concepts quicker. Guessing again.. this should maybe take 3hrs..?

## What's next

* Source control - git
* Tools - VSCode, GitHub, BitBucket
* Apps - TodoApp
* Frameworks - Node, React, Angular, NextJS
* Code camps
* Blogs and resumes
* APIs and databases
