This site is designed to help anyone interested in a career in software development learn some of the foundational elements that **I think** are important to getting started. I consider myself very pragmatic and do my best to follow the KISS principle, so I'll do my best to skip the fluff and get right down to the stuff. Web development jobs seem to be in high demand, and most pay well with lots of flexibility. Since I'm not a professional teacher, I'll be pointing you to links that I think are worthwhile.. though I admit I haven't gone through everything myself. Most of the links will be on Khan Academy, feel free to watch more and setup and account to help track your progress.

**PRO TIP**: *look for the speed setting on all videos. I watch everything in at least 2x speed and slow it down or repeat a section if I need to. That can cram 2hrs of learning into 1hr* ;-)
